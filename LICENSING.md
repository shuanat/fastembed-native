# FastEmbed Licensing

FastEmbed is dual-licensed:

- Open Source: GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)
- Commercial: Proprietary Commercial License (for closed-source and SaaS)

## Which license do I need?

- You are building open source, or internal tooling where you are willing to
  provide source code to users of the networked service → AGPL-3.0 is fine.
- You are a company using FastEmbed in a closed-source product or SaaS and you
  do not want to release your source code → Purchase a commercial license.

AGPL-3.0 requires that if you modify FastEmbed or build a networked service
that uses it, you must offer the complete corresponding source code of your
modified version to users of that service.

## Commercial License (royalty-based options)

We offer flexible commercial licensing, including:

- Per-seat or per-developer licensing
- Per-core / per-instance / per-cluster licensing
- Revenue-based royalty

Request a commercial license by opening a GitHub Issue using the
"License Request" template:

- New Issue → License Request (or open: issues/new?template=license_request.md)

Include:

- Company name and address
- Intended use (product/SaaS, on-prem, internal tool)
- Estimated scale (seats/cores or traffic)

We will follow up privately to generate an Order Form and
Commercial License (see LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md).
